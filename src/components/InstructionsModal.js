            Different letters in the game will have various point values and
            this will depend on how rare the letter is and how difficult it may
            be to lay that letter.

            Extra Point Values - When looking at the board, players will see
            that some squares offer multipliers. Should a tile be placed on
            these squares, the value of the tile will be multiplied by 2x or 3x.
            Some squares will also multiply the total value of the word and not
            just the single point value of one tile.
          </Typography>
          <Typography id="modal-modal-description" sx={typographyStyle}>
            Double Letter Scores - The light blue cells in the board are
            isolated and when these are used, they will double the value of the
            tile placed on that square.

            Triple Letter Score - The dark blue cell in the board will be worth
            triple the amount, so any tile placed here will earn more points.

          <Typography id="modal-modal-description" sx={typographyStyle}>
            Double Word Score - When a cell is light red in colour, it is a
            double word cell. When a word is placed on these squares, the entire
            value of the word will be doubled.
          </Typography>

            One Single Use - When using the extra point squares on the board,
            they can only be used one time. If a player places a word here, it
            cannot be used as a multiplier by placing another word on the same
            square.

            When the game begins, the player will place their word on the star
            in the centre of the board. The star is a double square and will
            offer a double word score. All players following will build their
            words off of this word, extending the game to other squares on the
            board.

            Replacing Scrabble Tiles - Once tiles are played on the board,
            players will be dealt new tiles to replace those. Players will
            always have seven tiles during the game.

            The Fifty Point Bonus - When players use all seven tiles to create a
